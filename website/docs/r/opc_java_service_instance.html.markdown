# opc\_java\_service\_instance

The ``opc_java_service_instance`` resource creates and manages a java service instance in an OPC identity domain.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "opc_database_service_instance" "default" {
  ...
}

resource "opc_java_service_instance" "test" {
  name = "test-java-service-instance-%d"
  type = "weblogic"
  shape = "oc1m"
  version = "12.2.1"
  public_key = "ssh-public-key"
  cloud_storage {
    container = "Storage-identitydomain/default"
    create_if_missing = true
  }
  database {
    name = "${opc_database_service_instance.default.name}"
    username = "sys"
    password = "Pass_Test9"
  }
  admin {
    username = "terraform-user"
    password = "Pass_Test8"
  }
}
```

The following is an example of how to provision a service instance with the Oracle Traffic Director:

```hcl
resource "opc_database_service_instance" "default" {
  ...
}

resource "opc_java_service_instance" "default" {
  name = "test-java-service-instance-%d"
  subscription_type = "HOURLY"
  weblogic {
    version = "12.2.1"
    edition = "EE"
    public_key = "ssh-public-key"
    shape = "oc1m"
    database {
      name = "${opc_database_service_instance.default.name}"
      username = "sys"
      password = "Pass_Test9"
    }
    admin {
      username = "terraform-user"
      password = "Pass_Test8"
    }
  }
  cloud_storage {
    container = "Storage-identitydomain/default"
    create_if_missing = true
